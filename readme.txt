== Description ==

LionScripts IP Blocker for WordPress allows you to block the malicious IP Addresses, Spammers and Hackers. You can block IP addresses by either using the manual blocking method or the Bulk IPs Blocking feature.

By blocking the Unwanted or Spammy IP Addresses, you can prevent hacking attempts and brute-force login attacks on your wordpress website. 

Hackers do the brute-force login attacks very often to gain the access to your website, which may become a negative signal to the shared hosting service provider for your website, leading to the account suspension too, if not taken care of very soon. Some of the folks got their hosting accounts banned from their shared hosting provider as the hacking attempts consumes server resources very hugely and impacts the performance of other user accounts on the same shared server. If you are using some cloud based services like AWS EC2 or Google Cloud Machine for hosting, then such hacking attempts eats-up the bandwidth, resources and increases the number of hours of usage & eventually the server bills significantly. But there's no need to worry now. That's exactly what the LionScripts IP Blocker resolves.

The blocked IPs won't be able to scrap the precious content too from your WordPress Site. You can choose to either display the blocked message or an empty page to the blocked users. To do so, you can just add the IP Address to the blocking list and anytime you can delete that IP from the blocking list if you know that it's not performing malicious activities.
